This ChatBot Application with Suggestion Feature can be accessed by the Site Management and the Public. On this application, visitors can simply query anything at the chatbox or conversation box. The system automatically browses a response for the query of the visitors and returns it to the visitor. This project also contains suggestion features. This feature provides suggestion keywords to the visitor or inquirer. Each suggestion is linked to a response. If the response has a list of suggestions keywords, the system will also return the suggestions along with the response. The suggestion feature goal is to provide the inquirer with a possible keyword that is related to the current response. This project has an admin panel where the management can access and manage the responses. The said side requires the users to log in to their system credentials to gain access to the features and functionalities of the Admin Panel. The application also generates a printable report for the responses. The Response Report contains the list of responses with the total number or count of time it was fetched. The list ordered from frequently fetched to least.
